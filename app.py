CHESS ENCRYPTION SCRIPT
Author: @Balaji303
Description: 
This script provides encryption and decryption functionalities using chess-based encoding techniques. 
It utilizes external `encode` and `decode` modules for converting files to and from encrypted formats.

Returns:
- input_file: Path to the source file to be encrypted.
- output_file_path: Path where the encrypted file will be saved.
